# Geoestimator - README
### General Information

Geoestimator: a game that involves determining the geographical location of a country given through a silhouetted/general shape of said country.

This a educationally-originated project created for the purpose of fulfilling an assignment's requirements at Del Norte High School for AP Computer Science Principles. Our [the developers'] coding skills and the project itself are still growing and are not polished/completed to their fullest potential.

### How to Use: Gameplay

- Users will be greeted at the website's original homepage
    - Users must navigate to the "Play" button at the top of the site
        - From there, a randomly generated country will immediately be given and users can jump straight into the gameplay
            - To enter an answer, simply type the name of a country (MUST BE SPELLED CORRECTLY) and hit the "Enter Answer" button
                - If the user answer is correct, the user will be given the option to generate another random country from the database; this will be allowed over and over again
                - If the user gets the answer incorrect, the direction and distance their guess was from the answer will be printed to aid in finding the correct country
- A timer and leaderboards will be in effect
- Hints towards the country's direction in relation to an incorrect guess will be given to aid in finding the correct country
